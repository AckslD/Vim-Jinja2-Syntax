This is the latest version of the Jinja2 syntax file for vim with the ability to detect either HTML or Jinja.

There are two reasons I made this repository:

- The version of this vim addon is out-of-date on vimscripts.

- I wanted to manage this syntax file with vim-addons-manager or whatever other vim plugins managers there are.

The current version is the [2020-01-06 version](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/d31e66c6ba5a9b4e8b610608f1a9bc114c3ec23c) from the official jinja repository.
If you notice there is a newer version available please send a pull request.

**If you have bugs or pull requests, please submit them straight to the [source](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2).** If the plugin is overzealous in detecting the Jinja syntax, send me the template it shouldn't have matched.
