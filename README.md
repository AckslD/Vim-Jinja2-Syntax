This is the latest version of the Jinja2 syntax file for vim with the ability to detect either HTML or Jinja.

There are two reasons I made this repository:

* The version of this vim addon is out-of-date on vimscripts.

* I wanted to manage this syntax file with vim-addons-manager or whatever other vim plugins managers there are.

This repository may not have the exact latest version of the jinja2 syntax file. If you notice it is out-of-date please message me.

**If you have bugs or pull requests, please submit them straight to the [source](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2).**
