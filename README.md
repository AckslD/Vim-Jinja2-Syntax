This is the latest version of the Jinja2 syntax file for vim.

The only reason I made this one is because the one on vimscripts is out of date and I want to use vim-addons-manager to easily update it.

Because I don't know of any way to watch a specific file on github, it is likely that I will miss updates to the jinja2 syntax file. If you notice mine is out of date, please message me.
